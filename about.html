          <h1>About CMU Enactus </h1>
          <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Enactus, standing for Entrepreneurial Action Us, is an international nonprofit organization founded in 1975. It has presence in over 1,600 universities across 36 countries, involving over 66,500 students with 7,400,000 project volunteer hours. The main goal of Enactus is to connect business and education with service to better communities around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Carnegie Mellon's Enactus chapter was founded by Sheel Mohnot and Neil Shah in 2000, along with a group of 4 dedicated project members. From then on, CMU Enactus has rapidly grown through energetic leaders, innovative projects and alliances with local corporations and other groups on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Carnegie Mellon's chapter has 5 main projects this year, including: Eco Markets, Project Pulse, Citizens Empowerment, Enactus Mexico, and Enactus Chile. We hope that through these local and international efforts, we can make a large impact on our communities by using and applying our business skills in different contexts.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp With these types of unique projects, Enactus teams from around the world also compete in a National competition for recognition and more than $400,000 in prize money every year. In addition to judging these competitions, corporate board members like Radio Shack and Walmart recruit heavily from Enactus talent. Some other companies represented on the board include 3M, Black & Decker, Coca-Cola, AT&T, ConAgra, Nestle and Pfizer as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Carnegie Mellon Enactus is proud to have an excellent history of success in participating at both the Regional and National Levels. Currently, Carnegie Mellon Enactus has quickly climbed from rookie in a pack of 800+ schools to the top 15 in 2012 after the National Competition. This year's goal is achieving top 4 in the national competition!
