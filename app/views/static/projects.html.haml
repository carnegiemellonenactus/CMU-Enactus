            Project Panama aims to bring together self-determined and passionate individuals to create a better, more sustainable world through the positive power of business in impoverished communities. We work towards community improvement by sustainable business development through education and training. Every year during spring break a team of students head down to Panama to work with various families to educate them and work with them on their problems in their small business. Apart from helping the communities, all the members of our team would agree that we gain just as much from the experience as we give; as we experience a new culture and meet extremely inspiring people.

            Citizen Empowerment seeks to provide a service to those that are in need. This year, CE is working with a local veteran facility to empower homeless and unemployed veterans personally and professionally. The project holds weekly, discussion-based workshops at the facility. Each workshop focuses in on  two concepts: one personal and one professional skill, that is highlighted and discussed. Using a basis of reflection and goal-setting, we hope to bring these valued members of our community closer to employment and permanent residency.

            Initiative: For nutrition, we plan to work towards healthier menus and healthy food handouts during exam week. For stress and fitness our activities will include 5k training sessions and anti-stress events in conjunction with CAPS and Peer Health Advocates. We also will focus on medicine. We hope to host a toiletry drive (estimating first week of December) which will hopefully be at the school, and we also plan to collect and distribute medicine samples, vaccines, and medical products from UPMC hospital.
