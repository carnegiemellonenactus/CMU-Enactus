            Founded 25 years ago, Enactus national chapters originally began in small town colleges in the U.S. and have expanded rapidly to larger schools like Carnegie Mellon, Harvard, Notre Dame, and other universities worldwide. Enactus has recruited more than 200 executives to its board, and is currently headed by Mr. Robert E. Rich, Jr., of Rich Products Corporation. Other companies represented on the board include 3M, Black & Decker, Coca-Cola, AT&T, ConAgra, Nestle and Pfizer.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carnegie Mellon Enactus was founded by Sheel Mohnot and Neil Shah in 2000, along with a group of 4 dedicated project members. From then on, CMU Enactus has rapidly grown through energetic leaders, innovative projects and alliances with local corporations and other groups on campus.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each year, Enactus teams from around the world initiate outreach projects and then compete in a regional competition for recognization and more than $400,000 in prize money. Regional champions go on to the National Competition, and National champions go on to the Global Competition. In addition to judging regional, national and the international World Cup Enactus competitions, corporate board members like Radio Shack and Walmart recruit heavily from Enactus talent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Carnegie Mellon Enactus is proud to have an excellent history of success in participating at both the Regional and National Levels. Currently, Carnegie Mellon Enactus has quickly climbed from rookie in a pack of 800+ schools to the top 15 in 2012 after the National Competition. This year's goal is achieving top 4 in the national competition and the World Cup!
