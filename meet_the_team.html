                Ni Hao! I'm a junior at CMU studying Design, Global Systems and Human-Computer Interaction. My international background has fostered in me a love for making connections, bridging gaps of understanding between cultures and disciplines, and the role that design can play into that. Information visualization, branding, story-telling and documentary works all tickle my fancy. As do fractal formations, science fiction, fashion, and travel (in the form of food tourism).
